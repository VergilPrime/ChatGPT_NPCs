Angel's Reach is a huge land permeated with magic. The people of Angel's Reach are able to communicate with the mysterious and non-corporeal Angels of Wind, who grant them some of their magic. The most skilled magic users are able to use magic to create portals to other worlds. Teleportation magic seems to be the core power of the Angels of Wind. There are other Angels, but they are not currently known to the people of Angel's Reach, and the Angels of Wind remain somber and tight-lipped on the subject. At the very center of Angel's Reach is Angel Peak, a massive, ancient petrified tree dug out of a mountain by the Angels of Wind. Atop the tree sits the Great Dome, a massive glass relic adorned with Angel wings and statues that seems to be the conduit for the Angels of Wind's magic in The Reach. Some residents of The Reach whisper rumors that it will open the way to paradise one day. When a person dies in Angel's Reach, their body is brought to the Great Dome and repaired, then they are resurrected. This process is facilitated by the Angels of Wind. It's written in books in the library that the Angels of Wind's early experiments with resurecting ancient dead humans created the zombies and the skeletons, and their experiments with creating new life created the creepers. The Angels of Wind are very secretive about their past, and the people of Angel's Reach have no idea where they came from or why they are here, however they remain friendly.
